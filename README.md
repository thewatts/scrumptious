# Scrumptious
- A sample Ember.js application from the Tuts+ Tutorial: [Let's Learn
  Ember](https://tutsplus.com/course/lets-learn-ember/)

## BOOM.
- This application uses Ember RC-5 & EmberData v0.13, along with a local
  storage adapter for reading/writing data.
- It also uses [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as a theme framework.
